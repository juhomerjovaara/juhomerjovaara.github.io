				<div class="image main" id="bigPicture"><img src="/images/juho2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>My journey in IT started during my studies at Helsinki Business College. After completing my dual
					qualification in Vocational Qualification in Business Information Technology and completing the
					Finnish Matriculation Examination I was fortunate enough to get an internship position at
					Raha-automaattiyhdistys (RAY, Finland’s Slot Machine Association, these days Veikkaus Oy). During my
					internship I worked as a Testing Trainee on a program used to channel funds. At the same time I was
					in charge of the program’s customer service with another worker. After completing my internship, I
					was able to stay at RAY and my title was upgraded to System Tester. A few months later I was
					transferred to the unit I really wanted to work in all along, the game development branch. The
					testing team to be precise.</p>
				<p>My responsibilities were mostly testing slot machine games, online casino games and payment methods.
					During my time I learned a lot of the gaming industry and realized that this was the field I want to
					work in. After RAY I stated working In a smaller point company called Crafthouse Oy. My title was
					for the first few years was System Specialist and I did things such as POS System implementation,
					customer training, general customer service via phone, email and remote-control software, customer
					version updates, on call duty etc. I knew I wanted to get back to the gaming field and applied to
					Metropolia University of Applied Sciences for their Game Development major a degree in Bachelor of
					Engineering.</p>
				<p>I started school and continued working at Crafthouse Oy as a Software Tester. As the only tester I
					was in charge of the testing of multiple key products including POS systems, management software,
					web stores and POS hardware. During my studies I have learned a lot about game development, game
					design, programming (mostly C# and C++), game engines (mostly Unity), developing for different
					platforms (PC, mobile, VR, AR, consoles), 3D (Blender, Autodesk products), databases and a lot more.
					I have been a part of multiple school game projects and created games on my own. </p>
				<p>At the end of 2018 I moved to Calgary, Canada for student exchange and studied at the Mount Royal
					University for the winter semester. </p>
				<p>In 2019 I was a part of a group that is created an online game that combines VR and AR for Helsinki
					XR Center as a school project. My responsibilities were mostly in VR programming and level
					generation.</p>
				<p>In 2020 I moved to Amsterdam to do an internship at DTT. I was a part of the Unity team and worked on
					the Edu Play Book project. My internship was unfortunately cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
				</p>
				<p>I have a lot of experience in the IT field and in non-professional gaming projects. I know I am ready
					to take the next step in my game development career.</p>
